It is a management system for Node packages.

### 2. What problem does Node.JS solve (Is there any problem that can be solved with Node.JS ü§î)?

Node.JS solves the problem of memory usage for spawning threads by avoiding creating new threads by 
executing events within the execution process.

### 3. What is the V8 Javascript Engine?

It is an open source engine created for Javascript. It allows to execute Javascript code.

### 4. Is Node.JS really necessary in the Development ecosystem?

It is very necessary because it is currently one of the best options for web development and 
is widely used by big companies.

### Why not use PHP or Golang?

Because Node.JS brings together all the positive characteristics of both in a single environment.

### 5. What is the difference between Node.JS and any other browser?

The difference is that Node.JS is highly scalable and event-driven.

### Are Node.JS and a browser the same?

No, unlike the browser where Javascript is sandboxed for your safety, node. js has full access to 
the system like any other native application.

### 6. What is NVM and Why is it useful for Node.JS developers?

NVM is a software that allows to download and manage Node.JS versions, 
it is useful because it helps to solve typical npm problems. 


***
## 2. Node.JS Module System
### 1. What is a Javascript Module?

It is a Javascript code file that can be ported from other parts of the 
application. parts of the application.

### 2. Why are Javascript Modules necessary?
They are necessary to be able to reuse code efficiently.

### 3. What module standards are available in Node.JS?

Some of the modules are fs, path, querystring, http and https, etc.


### 4. What are the differences between ESModules and CommonJS modules?

The difference is that CommonJS only allows to load modules synchronously and 
ESModules allows to load modules synchronously and asynchronously.

### 5. Which types of modules exist in Node.JS?

Node.JS includes three types of modules: Core Modules, Local Modules y Third Party Modules.

### 0. Why do we run the npm init command and not node init to create a new Node.JS project?

Because npm is used to update or create Node packages.

### 1. When you entered the npm init command and answered the questions you saw in the terminal, a new file called packacke.json was generated.

### What does this file do?

Maintains the history of installed packages.

### Why is this file generated?

It is automatically generated to optimize the way dependencies are generated.
***
## 4. Node.JS Module System - Practice

### main.js
```javascript
const { sum, subtract }  = require("./operations");

console.log(sum(1, 2))
console.log(subtract(1, 2))
```

### operations.js

```javascript
const sum = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 + num2;
}
const subtract = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 - num2;
}

module.exports = { sum, subtract };
```
